# Marvel Browser: A TDD Case Study

This is slowly becoming an iOS sample app to showcase Test Driven Development
(TDD). The commit log shows you my sub-steps and thoughts as I progress.

To build the project:

  1. Get your own keys from http://developer.marvel.com
  2. Inside MarvelBrowser/MarvelBrowser, copy MarvelKeys.m-template to MarvelKeys.m
  3. Edit MarvelKeys.m, filling in your own keys. This file is ignored by Git.
